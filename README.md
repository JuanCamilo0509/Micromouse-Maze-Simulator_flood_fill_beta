## Introduction
Micromice are essentially mini maze-solving robots. A large part of developing the intelligence powering a micromouse is creating smart maze solving algorithms. This maze simulator aims to aid in the development and testing of maze solving algorithms by providing a graphical visualization of these algorithms in action.

This repository contains two tools:
- Simulator: graphic visualizer for maze solving algorithms
- Editor: tool for creating and editing maze files for use by the simulator

There are additionally a handful of ready made maze files (available in the Mazes folder) for use in the simulator. Most of these are based off real maze layouts used in past Micromouse competitions.
