## Introduction
Micromice are essentially mini maze-solving robots. A large part of developing the intelligence powering a micromouse is creating smart maze solving algorithms. This maze simulator aims to aid in the development and testing of maze solving algorithms by providing a graphical visualization of these algorithms in action.
